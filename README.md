In the event of a predictable natural disasters our programme aims to help disperse the soon to be affected population by distributing people to their respective safe zones by providing them with appropriate  directions to leave the hazardous zone. 
This is done in a manner so that no particular area is overcrowded and efficiency is ensured by making sure that no particular exit road is clogged with traffic. 
This helps to minimise loss of life and economic losses due to poor dispersal of people before a natural disaster.
An additional feature of this programme can be to provide special routes for ambulances etc. 
To sum up our code helps disperse a large number of people in an orderly and efficient manner.
